cost = decides the number of key expansion rounds or iterations of the algorithm

Bcrypt generates a random salt to be used in those iterations to protect against the rainbow table attack

Becaus eof this random salt, the algorithm will give you a completely different output hash value even if the same input password is provided

The cost and hash will also be added to the final hash to produce the final hash string

Hashed_String = ALG + COST + SALT + HASH
